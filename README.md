Data Exploration, Visualisation and Science with R

    Data Exploration:
        Definition: Data exploration involves the initial investigation of a dataset to understand its structure, characteristics, and patterns. It includes summarizing key statistics, identifying trends, detecting outliers, and gaining insights into the nature of the data.

    Data Visualization:
        Definition: Data visualization is the presentation of data in graphical or visual formats, such as charts, graphs, or maps. The goal is to convey complex information in a more understandable and interpretable manner, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

    Data Wrangling:
        Definition: Data wrangling, also known as data munging, is the process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data into a format suitable for analysis. It involves handling missing data, correcting errors, converting data types, and restructuring datasets to make them more usable and meaningful.

    Data Analysis:
        Definition: Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, draw conclusions, and support decision-making. It involves applying statistical and mathematical techniques to understand patterns, relationships, and trends within the data.

    Data Science:
        Definition: Data science is a multidisciplinary field that combines various techniques, methods, and tools from statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge to extract insights and knowledge from data. It encompasses data analysis, machine learning, predictive modeling, and other advanced analytics approaches. In summary, data exploration is the initial stage of understanding a dataset, data visualization is the presentation of data in visual forms, data wrangling involves preparing and cleaning data, data analysis involves extracting insights from data, and data science is a broader field that encompasses various aspects of working with data to gain knowledge and make informed decisions.
